eromdir - PS2 erom dump files extractor
---------------------------------------

The goal this program is to allow to list files from an Encrypted PlayStation2
ROM dump file. It simply does what the PS2 does to access the 'erom' 
filesystem.

Looking at late Playstation 2 models Encrypted ROM (7000x BIOS and above) will
list around 50 files, some files contains binary code for the DVDplayer, some
other files are gzip compressed resources. 
Older models only had 2 files in their Encrypted ROM: DVDELF and UDFIO driver.

To build eromdir you need autotools and gcc compiler:
- first run the bootstrap script (thanks to Sam Hocevar for writing it)
- configure
- make
